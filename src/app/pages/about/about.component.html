        Sabella is an artist, designer, and writer from Chicago now living in Seattle. She creates under the moniker <strong>“the monarq”</strong> which is a multidisciplinary art practice. Her move to the Pacific Northwest led to a reexamination of the factors that shaped her identity. New geography and culture sparked new ways of looking—at both external and internal landscapes. Her practice is an attempt to answer pressing questions: How do you make a home after leaving home behind? How do you integrate the past into potential futures? Channeling these concerns through photography, collage, pattern making, and portraiture, she has developed a multidisciplinary body of work that engages this fundamental yet elusive concept of selfhood.
